# MRST Bio-Chemistry Module for Hydrogen Storage Simulation

A comprehensive MATLAB Reservoir Simulation Toolbox (MRST) module for simulating hydrogen storage in depleted reservoirs with bio-chemical reactions and compositional modeling.

## Overview

This module extends MRST's capabilities by integrating a bio-chemistry model with the compositional simulator, specifically designed for hydrogen storage applications. It implements the Soreide-Whitson (SW) equation of state fitted to experimental data and enables simulation of microbial activity affecting hydrogen storage operations.

### Key Features

- **Compositional Modeling**: Full compositional simulation for H₂O-H₂-CO₂-CH₄-N₂ mixtures
- **Bio-Chemistry Integration**: Microbial growth and methanogenesis reactions
- **Equation of State**: Soreide-Whitson EoS fitted to experimental data
- **Bacterial Effects**: Simulation of hydrogen loss due to microbial activity

### Optional PHREEQC backends

`setupH2StorageExampleWithSRB_benchmark` supports exactly two PHREEQC backends. Both require Windows, a registered
`IPhreeqcCOM.Object` (or configured `phreeqcComProgId`), and an explicit absolute `phreeqcDatabaseFile` path to
`h2_biogeochemistry.dat`. The database is bundled at
[`h2-biochem/database/h2_biogeochemistry.dat`](database/h2_biogeochemistry.dat).
The database is a renamed, unmodified copy from [UGFACT](https://github.com/ahmadrezashojaee/UGFACT); [source revision and checksum](database/README.md) are recorded alongside it.
After running `startupH2sim`, `which('h2_biogeochemistry.dat')` resolves it automatically.

Set `phreeqcBackend='sequential-compositional-phreeqc'` with `phreeqcTimestepCoupling=true` to run the post-convergence
compositional kinetics/chemistry split.

The COM split carries separate PHREEQC MET/ACE/SRB biomass (`N0=1e9`, `Nmax=1e13` cells/kg water) and disables MRST's
implicit microbial reaction sources to avoid double counting; aqueous tracer transport (SO4, HS, HCO3, Ca, Mg) remains
active. `bactDiffusion` and `chemotaxisEffect` are rejected for this backend: PHREEQC integrates only local per-cell
kinetics with no notion of spatial bacterial transport, so `nbact` cannot be diffused or chemotaxis-moved independently
of the biomass PHREEQC is actually growing.  Since its reaction source is also zero here, MRST does not assemble
`nbact`'s mass-balance equation at all for this backend (it would be a pure no-op every step); `nbact` is still carried
as a state field, and `PsiGrowthRate`/`CarbonLimitedGrowthRate`/`BacterialMass` remain available as diagnostic-only
outputs. It maps the prescribed selected-output schema back to tracers, minerals, and EOS inventories before
reflashing. This sequential coupling is not claimed to exactly reproduce any paper or external benchmark.

The compositional backend records per-cell H, C, S, Ca, Mg, and Fe
conservation diagnostics and warns when its configured tolerances are exceeded.
Its returned state records the
`nc`-by-6 diagnostics `phreeqcElementBalanceInput`,
`phreeqcElementBalanceOutput`, `phreeqcElementBalanceAbsoluteResidual`,
`phreeqcElementBalanceNormalizedResidual`, and
`phreeqcElementBalancePass`; column names are in
`phreeqcElementBalanceElements`. Configure scalar or six-element tolerances
with `phreeqcElementBalanceAbsoluteTolerance` (default `1e-7` mol) and
`phreeqcElementBalanceRelativeTolerance` (default `1e-8`) in
`phreeqcCouplingOptions`.

The current multirate working implementation has its elemental audit disabled;
its post-PHREEQC EOS component-inventory audit remains active. Consequently,
a passing EOS inventory audit alone does not establish elemental conservation
through the chemistry handoff.

The audit covers aqueous analytical totals (including the separate acetate
element), EOS H2/CO2/CH4/H2S, and all configured equilibrium minerals. Hydrogen
uses PHREEQC's system inventory with the fixed initial 1 kg solvent-water
baseline removed, avoiding subtraction of cell-scale solvent hydrogen while
retaining reaction- and hydrate-water changes. The compositional backend's
kinetic biomass is outside the reactive-element inventory because its PHREEQC
definition has `-formula H 0` and defines no C, S, Ca, Mg, or Fe storage;
MET/ACE/SRB kinetic amounts are reaction extents rather than stored products.
MRST `nbact` is likewise outside the equilibrium-only boundary.

`phreeqcBackend='sequential-h2biochem-phreeqc'` retains MRST's biochemical
sources and adds sequential PHREEQC equilibrium feedback.
It also requires a registered IPhreeqcCOM server and an absolute
`h2_biogeochemistry.dat` path, but contains **no** PHREEQC `RATES` or
`KINETICS`. MRST's existing `state.nbact` Monod model remains the sole
reaction owner: bacterial growth, `BactConvertionRate`, and tracer reaction
sources remain active.

```matlab
[~, model, schedule, state0] = setupH2StorageExampleWithSRB_benchmark( ...
    'phreeqcBackend', 'sequential-h2biochem-phreeqc', ...
    'phreeqcTimestepCoupling', true, ...
    'phreeqcDatabaseFile', which('h2_biogeochemistry.dat'));
[wellSols, states, report] = simulateSequentialH2BiochemPhreeqc( ...
    state0, model, schedule);
```

Run this backend with `simulateSequentialH2BiochemPhreeqc`, rather than
directly with `simulateScheduleAD`. For every nominal schedule timestep, the
wrapper repeats the MRST solve from the fixed timestep-start state, then
equilibrates the already-reacted full component, tracer, gas, and mineral
inventories in PHREEQC. The relaxed preceding PHREEQC pH, DIC/CO2, and sulfate
snapshot is supplied only to MRST's Monod kinetic substrate evaluation; it is
not an MRST nonlinear initial guess or an accumulation state. Iteration stops
only when that chemistry feedback and the MRST-reported reaction extent
(`h2ConsumptionRate * dt`) meet configured tolerances, otherwise it raises a
nonconvergence error. It is therefore a same-timestep outer Picard scheme, not
a lagged post-step chemistry split.

### Biochemical Reaction Model

The module simulates the methanogenesis reaction:
\[
4\text{H}_2 + \text{CO}_2 \longrightarrow \text{CH}_4 + 2\text{H}_2\text{O} + \text{energy}
\]

## Installation

### Prerequisites

- **MATLAB**: Version R2021a or newer
- **MRST**: MATLAB Reservoir Simulation Toolbox (2023b or newer)
- **Required MRST Modules**:
  - `compositional`
  - `ad-blackoil` 
  - `ad-core`
  - `ad-props`
  - `h2store`
  -`biochemistry`

### Terminal profiling

From the H2sim repository root under WSL, run:

```bash
bash run_matlab_h2sim.sh "results = profilePhreeqcWorkflows;"
```

The launcher uses Windows MATLAB R2026a, initializes this checkout from the
standard MATLAB path, and propagates MATLAB's batch exit status. Set
`MATLAB_BIN` to another Windows MATLAB executable's WSL path when needed.
The Windows COM backends require access to your MATLAB license server.

`profilePhreeqcWorkflows` profiles each baseline and compares three alternating
unprofiled baseline/candidate pairs. The candidates are the multirate local
pressure bracket and compositional cell batching. The default benchmark uses
50 cells and two 2-day flow steps, with 0.4-day multirate reaction substeps.
Simulation tolerances are unchanged. State comparisons combine field-specific
absolute tolerances with a relative tolerance of `1e-6`. Multirate EOS inventory
audits must pass; compositional elemental audit warnings are retained in the
saved states and reported without changing their existing warning policy. Profiles, paired states, comparisons and
timings are saved in `build/phreeqc-performance`, using local temporary files
before copying to the WSL filesystem.

Select a backend or reuse a completed profile with:

```matlab
results = profilePhreeqcWorkflows('backends', {'multirate'}, ...
    'collectProfiles', false, 'trials', 3);
```

Validated defaults use batches of up to 50 compositional cells and the local
multirate pressure bracket with the original fzero fallback. Set
`sequentialCompositionalPhreeqcBatchSize` to `1` or
`phreeqcReflashLocalBracket` to `false` to reproduce the respective baselines.
Three serial alternating trials at the benchmark settings gave median
simulation times of 30.10 -> 24.11 seconds for compositional and
168.35 -> 90.91 seconds for multirate. All compared compositional fields
matched exactly; multirate differences passed the stated inventory-based
absolute/relative tolerances. These short-case timings exclude startup and
model construction and do not establish full-schedule speedups.

### Publication figures

The PHREEQC examples share labeled panels, consistent case colors and line
styles, and vector PDF / 300-dpi PNG export to `build/phreeqc-figures`.
Distance is measured at cell centers using the actual domain edges, so the
first and last cells lie inside the interval `0 < x/L < 1`. Percentage labels
state whether injection is cumulative to date or the total scheduled amount.

```matlab
% Short injection-only mineral comparison (the full default is 50 days):
comparison = exampleCompositionalBacterial1DPhreeqcMinerals( ...
    'gridCells', 4, 'maximumFlowSteps', 2);
% Short multirate case with publication figures:
summary = exampleSequentialBiochemistryPhreeqc1D( ...
    'maximumFlowSteps', 2, 'plotResults', true);
% Redraw completed runs without solving again:
plotPhreeqcMineralComparison(comparison);
plotSequentialBiochemistryPhreeqc(summary);
% For results returned by runThreeBackendComparison:
% plotPhreeqcBackendComparison(scenarios);
```

Pass `outputDirectory` to choose the export location; an empty string disables
export. Set `plotResults` to false to run a case without plotting. Mineral
case labels include rock names, and pH is shown only for PHREEQC cases that
provide it. Backend profile panels share a y scale for each plotted quantity;
phase boundaries and snapshot times come from the result schedules. Mineral
consumption uses separate labeled scales for the original and PHREEQC kinetics,
with printed totals; detail panels preserve the smaller mineral-case differences.
