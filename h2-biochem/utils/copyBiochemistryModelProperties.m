function target = copyBiochemistryModelProperties(source, target)
%Copy every shared public property from SOURCE onto TARGET.
%
% SYNOPSIS:
%   target = copyBiochemistryModelProperties(source, target)
%
% DESCRIPTION:
%   Copies every publicly gettable/settable property of TARGET that also
%   exists (and is publicly readable) on SOURCE, using metaclass
%   reflection. This is used by SequentialBiochemistryPhreeqcModel to
%   build its internal flow-stage/reaction-stage sub-models so they share
%   an identical configuration with the fully configured meta-model they
%   were built from (including any options set after the base
%   BiochemistryPhreeqcModel constructor ran, e.g. a custom EOSModel or
%   bact_capProp/bact_maxProp), without maintaining a manually duplicated
%   list of constructor option names. It is also reused by
%   convertToSequentialBiochemistryPhreeqcModel to convert an existing,
%   fully configured BiochemistryPhreeqcModel benchmark model into a
%   SequentialBiochemistryPhreeqcModel.
%
%   Properties that are Constant, Transient, Dependent, or not publicly
%   accessible on either SOURCE or TARGET are skipped, as are properties
%   that only one of the two objects has (e.g. SequentialBiochemistry-
%   PhreeqcModel-only properties are simply not present on the plain
%   BiochemistryPhreeqcModel stage sub-models, so they are silently
%   skipped when copying onto those sub-models).
%
% PARAMETERS:
%   source - Fully configured model instance to copy FROM.
%   target - Model instance to copy properties ONTO.
%
% RETURNS:
%   target - TARGET with every shared public property set equal to the
%            corresponding property on SOURCE.
%
% SEE ALSO:
%   SequentialBiochemistryPhreeqcModel,
%   convertToSequentialBiochemistryPhreeqcModel

    % The set of copyable property NAMES depends only on the pair of
    % classes involved (property existence, access modifiers, and
    % Constant/Transient/Dependent flags are all static, class-level
    % facts for these plain classdef model hierarchies -- no dynamicprops
    % are used anywhere in it), never on instance state. SequentialBio-
    % chemistryPhreeqcModel.buildStageModels calls this once per control
    % step (validateModel rebuilds the stage models unconditionally on
    % every step), so the underlying metaclass reflection below is
    % memoized per (source class, target class) pair the first time it is
    % needed and reused on every later call instead of being recomputed
    % from scratch each step. Only the property VALUES are read fresh
    % from SOURCE on every call.
